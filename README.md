# Android Vulkan Configuration Utility
## (Mainly used for S23/S23+/S23U | Execution: macOS/Linux PC via USB or On-Device)
This repository contains scripts to force Vulkan rendering on Samsung Galaxy S23 series devices (tested on non-Samsung devices as well, but it is optimized for the S23 series):

- **Linux/PC Script:**  
  `opengl-to-vulkan.sh` is the upstream menu-driven Bash script to enable Vulkan rendering via ADB from a Linux PC.
- **macOS Script:**  
  `opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh` is a macOS-friendly variant based on v2.6.0. It avoids GNU-only command options, uses macOS-safe terminal output, stores temporary files in a `mktemp` directory, and supports shortcut flags such as `--full`, `--basic`, `--blacklist`, `--reboot`, `--updates`, and `--help`.
- **Without PC Script:**  
  A script to perform the same operation directly from your phone using Termux and Shizuku.  
  See the [Without PC readme](https://github.com/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/blob/main/Without_PC/readme.md) for detailed instructions.

Tested by the author on S23U running on OneUI 7, and based on community recommendations, this tool may improve performance, reduce device heat, and extend battery life.  

> **Note:** All changes are temporary and revert on device reboot.(not the auto-optimization restart)

## Overview

**Vulkan** is a modern, low-overhead graphics API that offers improved performance and efficiency over older APIs like OpenGL. 

---

## Features

- Easy menu-driven interface with safety warnings and notices
- Forces Vulkan rendering via ADB
- Offers two modes for applying Vulkan:
   - Basic mode
   - Complete mode 
- macOS helper script with ASCII-safe output and shortcuts for common actions
- Blacklist apps to prevent crashes(based on [Reddit recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1kgnzru/comment/mr0qdd4/)) which may help prevent crashes for certain apps. While results may vary, this non-breaking change is worth trying if you experience issues with specific applications.
- Clear instructions and user prompts

---
## Vulkan Modes

### Basic Mode
- Only restarts key system apps (SystemUI, Settings, Launcher, AOD, Keyboard)
- Quick (completes in seconds)
- Suitable for users who want a fast application of Vulkan

### Complete Mode
- Force-stops most apps and intelligently relaunches previously running apps and widgets
- More thorough application of Vulkan across the entire system
- Takes slightly longer to complete (1-2 minutes)
- Recommended for users who want the most comprehensive Vulkan implementation
- All previously reported bugs have been fixed in this version
  
---

## Requirements

- macOS or Linux PC
- [ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) installed:
  - macOS with Homebrew: `brew install android-platform-tools`
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install android-sdk-platform-tools gawk grep coreutils unzip`
  - Fedora/RHEL/CentOS: `sudo dnf install android-tools gawk grep coreutils unzip`
- Samsung Galaxy S23/S23+/S23U
- USB Debugging enabled on your phone (`Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging`)
- A suitable USB cable for connection

---

## Installation / How to switch to Vulkan

Clone this fork and enter the project folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/barq-al-layl/s23-vulkan-support.git
cd s23-vulkan-support
```

### macOS

Run the macOS script:
```
chmod +x opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh
```

The full Vulkan flow is the default recommended menu action. You can also run actions directly:
```
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh --full
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh --basic
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh --blacklist
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh --reboot
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh --updates
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh --help
```

### Linux

Run the upstream Linux script:
```
chmod +x opengl-to-vulkan.sh
./opengl-to-vulkan.sh
```

### Latest upstream release for Linux

If you want to install the latest upstream release and run the Linux script, paste this in the terminal:
```
api_response=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/releases/latest)
latest_version=$(echo "$api_response" | grep -o '"tag_name": *"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
latest_version_clean=$(echo "$latest_version" | sed 's/^v//')
wget https://github.com/Ameen-Sha-Cheerangan/s23-vulkan-support/archive/refs/tags/$latest_version.zip
unzip $latest_version*.zip && rm $latest_version*.zip* && cd s23-vulkan-support-$latest_version
chmod +x opengl-to-vulkan.sh
./opengl-to-vulkan.sh
```
Follow the on-screen menu instructions.


### Do this if you want to use an existing installation (only if build >= 2.5.5; not recommended)

```
cd ~ && cd s23-vulkan-support-{<Fill in the latest version>}
./opengl-to-vulkan.sh
```
On macOS, run:
```
./opengl-to-vulkan-macos.sh
```
This can be used to execute the script after restart. Auto-optimisation restart does not need reapplying, as it will not revert to OpenGL. For Linux, the latest upstream release command above is still recommended.

---

## Additional Notes

- All changes made by the script are **temporary** and will **reset on device reboot**.
- **Visual Artifacts** : Some users may experience visual glitches or artifacting when Vulkan is enabled. While Adreno GPUs in the S23 series usually handle Vulkan well, your experience may vary.
- **App Compatibility**  
  Not all apps will run properly under Vulkan. The majority do, but exceptions exist due to incomplete support from Samsung and app developers. There has been some methods shared in reddit community like below(3rd option when you run the script)
     - blacklist workaround suggested by [user](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1kgnzru/comment/mr0qdd4/) on Reddit.
- **Blacklist Management**
     - Add apps to blacklist by editing blacklist.txt (one package name per line)
     - Remove apps from blacklist by editing blacklist.txt and re-running the blacklist option.
- **macOS temporary files** are written under macOS temporary storage and cleaned up automatically when the script exits.
- **Samsung auto optimisation restarts wont reset Vulkan rendering** - only a normal device reboot will revert to OpenGL
- If you experience any issues after enabling Vulkan, simply reboot your device to return to OpenGL rendering.
### Known issues
- Some widgets may require a tap to load, after forcing vulkan.

---

## Uninstall / Switch Back to OpenGL

- To revert your device back to OpenGL rendering, **simply restart your phone**.  
- No files or settings need to be removed-rebooting the device will reset the GPU renderer to its default (OpenGL).


---

## Warnings

- **All changes are temporary!** Vulkan rendering will reset after a device reboot.(auto-optimisation restart won't remove the changes though)
- The blacklist feature is based on a Reddit user's recommendation and may not work for everyone.

## How to Check if Vulkan is Active

To verify that Vulkan rendering is enabled:

1. **Open Developer Options** on your device.
2. **Enable GPUWatch.**
3. **Open any app** (for example, the Dialer).
4. GPUWatch will display an overlay-look for the renderer information.
   - If Vulkan is active, it will show something like: **Vulkan**

This is the easiest way to confirm that Vulkan is running on your Galaxy S23/S23+/S23U device.

## FAQ

### What is Vulkan, why should I switch to it?

Vulkan is a modern graphics API that offers more efficient, low-overhead access to your device’s GPU compared to OpenGL. Switching to Vulkan can improve performance, reduce device heat, and extend battery life as reported by reddit users in S23 Ultra reddit community.


### I see error related to "user 150" in the output. Is this a problem?

No, this is expected and harmless. This message appears because some apps-such as those inside Samsung Secure Folder or other secondary user profiles-cannot be controlled by ADB shell commands unless the device is rooted. The shell user (used by ADB) only has permission to control apps for the main device user (user 0), not for additional users like user 150 (which is typically Secure Folder). Your main device user (user 0) is still fully handled by the script, and this message can be safely ignored
